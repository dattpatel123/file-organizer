# File Organizer 

File Organizer is a powerful local application designed to simplify and streamline the management of digital files using Google's Gemini API. Tailored for ease of use, this application allows users to easily organize their files into categorized folders, all within a user-friendly interface powered by Flask.




## Important:

- #### It may take a bit to upload all the files so please wait for all files to completely upload

- #### Also, it may take a little bit to organize files after clicking organize so please wait and do not click out of website.

- #### It only accepts files (images, videos, audios, softwares, etc) to organize, and NOT folders. Dragging folders will add everything in that folder to be organized, which will lead to a different organization

- #### If you face any errors, kindly go to http://127.0.0.1:5000/ or refresh and then click Restart. Now reupload your files.
